		<h2>St. Elizabeth - Florence</h2>
		<h3>September 4, 2018</h3>
		<p>On September 4th, 2018, around noon, I was sitting in the parking lot getting ready to walk in for my therapy appointment. Before I could get out of the car, you called me. I don't remember what the conversation was word for word, but you told me that you "couldn't see out of [your] eye". I figured maybe you had just woken up and didn't rub your eyes enough. I said, "um, okay." You proceeded to tell me you spoke with your eye doctor and his office and they wanted you to come in to be looked at. (You'd had an appointment with him a week prior where they gave you an eye patch. They had checked the pressures in your eye but established nothing was wrong when it came to your glaucoma.) You told me you didn't want to drive since you couldn't see out of your eye and needed me to come pick you up. I told you I was about to walk in for my appointment and I asked you if it could wait. You said you had just woken up and needed to shower and to let you know when I was finished.<br><br>
		I finished with my appointment and texted you back to tell you I was done. I drove to your apartment (I was only <5 minutes away) and you got in the car. We drove to your eye doctor's office. They called you back and had a look at you and I waited in the lobby. After about 15-20 minutes, the eye doctor asked for me to come back. He demonstrated a vision test for me showing me that you could not see out of your left eye. At that point in time he had instructed his secretaries to track down Dr. Webb as they said he may be on call at Florence or Ft. Thomas. We never found out where exactly Dr. Webb was but the eye doctor instructed for me to take you to the emergency room and let them know that Dr. Webb knew you were on the way. He gave me a post-it note with his contact info to give to the ER. We got back in the car and drove to St. Elizabeth Florence.<br><br>
		We arrived at St. Elizabeth Florence. You were having the hardest time walking. I don't think it was from the stroke but more so because of your vision (I'm not sure). I eventually walked in and grabbed a wheelchair and wheeled you in. We checked in at the desk. They called you back and took vitals, asked you what you were experiencing. (Couldn't see out of left eye - like looking through a straw / saw two ceiling fans) After that was done, they put us in an exam room.<br><br>
		We waited in the exam room where they took you back for a CT. I can't remember if this was with or without contrast. However, that came back and they told you you'd experience a "small" stroke and they would be admitting you. <br>
		They admitted you and thus began your time at St. Elizabeth Florence. I didn't want to leave that night. Mainly because you told me about how Grandma Nalley had a stroke and ended up in a coma so I convinced myself if I left that was going to happen to you. But you were more concerned with the fact that I had to move to my new apartment the next day. Before all of this happened, you scheduled for movers to help me with my big furniture. On September 5th, I spent the day moving out of my apartment to my new one all by myself. I visited you later that night to tell you about it. By September 6th I was completely out of the old apartment. <br>
		I also posted on FB about what happened to you. LOTS of your friends asked about you. I definitely didn't do as well of a job keeping everyone posted but I just tried to update anytime something big happened. </p>
