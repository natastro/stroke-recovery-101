    <h2>Please read</h2>
    <p style="color: darkred;"><b>CW: DEATH</b></p>
    <p>The stories you are about to read entail my first-hand encounter of being my mom's caregiver and watching her go through two strokes. Please note there is a content warning. <br><br></p>
    <p><i>This is dedicated in loving memory of my mom, Tammy Nalley. I never wanted you to suffer but it does hurt not to be by your side everyday. My hope is you're finally reunited with your family the way you always wanted to be. I hope you know I never meant to put you through the Hell and torture that came with both of your strokes. I hope you'd agree with the decisions I made and still be proud of me. I'd do it all over again for you or go through this another 50 years with you if you needed me to. I love you with all of my heart and miss you so much. I hope I'll see you again real soon.</i></p>
