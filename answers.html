	<h2>"St Elizabeth Florence something about my IV and how many times they tried and it would not work and something about surgery or something?"</h2>
	<p>-During the first visit that you had at St. Elizabeth Florence, one of the last days before you went to HealthSouth, they would try to re-insert your IV for Arginine (not sure why they kept having to re-stick you) and it got to the place where your vein would blow so they had to try different spots. You started crying and begged them not to stick you again. I had to stand in your room with you to try to calm you down (it didn't help). I tried to play "Country Roads" and that didn't help. We did FaceTime Luke which helped a *little*. <br><br></p>

	<h2>"I have a puzzle piece about you and I eating dinner and some one cooked it for us."</h2>
	<p>-Someone from your class ordered food for us 2 or 3 weeks in a row. Paid for it and had it delivered. I took care of meeting the delivery person. </p>
